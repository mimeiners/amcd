title: Precision Rectifiers, Absolute value circuits
---

# Objective

The purpose of this experiment is to investigate precision rectifiers or
absolute value circuits. Rectifiers, or \'absolute-value\' circuits are
often used as detectors to convert the amplitudes of AC signals to DC
values to be more easily measured. For this type of circuit, the AC
signal is first high-pass filtered to remove any DC component and then
rectified and perhaps low pass filtered.

# Notes

In this tutorials we use the terminology taken from the user manual when
referring to the connections to the Red Pitaya STEMlab board
[hardware](http://redpitaya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/developerGuide/125-10/top.html).

# Background

As we have seen in the
[simple](http://red-pitaya-active-learning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Activity20_DiodeRectifiers.html)
[rectifier](http://red-pitaya-active-learning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Activity20_DiodeRectifiers.html)
circuits constructed with diodes, the circuit does not respond well to
signals with a magnitude less than a diode-drop (0.7V for silicon
diodes). This limits their use in designs where small amplitudes are to
be measured. For designs in which a high degree of precision is needed,
op-amps can be used in conjunction with diodes to build precision
rectifiers.

The inverting op-amp circuit can be converted into an "ideal" (linear
precision) half-wave rectifier by adding two diodes as shown in figure
2. For the negative half of the input diode D1 is reverse biased and
diode D2 is forward biased and the circuit operates as a conventional
inverter with a gain of -1. For the positive half of the input, diode D1
is forward biased, closing the feedback around the amplifier. Diode D2
is reverse biased disconnecting the output from the amplifier. The
output will be at the virtual ground potential ( - input terminal )
through the 10kΩ resistor.

## Procedure

1.  Build the circuit from figure 1 on the breadboard

2.  Start the Oscilloscope & Signal generator application
3.  In the OUT1 settings menu set Amplitude value to 0.5V, DC offset to
    0.1 V, Frequency to 100Hz to apply the input voltage. From the
    waveform menu select SINE, deselect SHOW and select enable.
4.  On the left bottom of the screen be sure that IN1 and IN2 V/div are
    set to 200mV/div (You can set V/div by selecting the desired channel
    and using vertical +/- controls
5.  Set t/div value to 2ms/div (You can set t/div using horizontal +/-
    controls)

Note

From the measurements shown on picture 3 we can observe following: The
peak of the rectified output should now equal to the peak value of the
input (only AC peak, note that DC level of the input signal is not
transfered to the output). There is also a sharp transition as the input
crosses zero. The experimenter should investigate the waveforms at
different points in the circuit to explain why this circuit works better
than the simple diode half wave rectifier.
:::

For this experiment you should:

a)  Try to change OUT1 DC offset and amplitude and observe results.
b)  Study the circuit and determine how it works. There is a very
    fundamental concept that should help in understanding how this
    circuit operates. Given an op-amp configured with negative feedback,
    the inverting and non-inverting input terminals will try to reach
    the same voltage level, often referred to as a "virtual ground.
c)  Plan some tests to see if this circuit indeed is a rectifying
    circuit. Perform these tests, fully documenting all tests and
    results in your lab report.
d)  Carefully measure and record voltages at all nodes in the circuit.

## Questions

1.  What happens if the direction of the diodes is reversed? Repeat
    experiment with the direction of both diodes reversed.

# Full wave rectifier

We can modify the half wave rectifier to make full wave rectifier or
absolute value circuit. The circuit shown in figure 4 is an absolute
value circuit, often called a precision full-wave rectifier. It should
operate like a full wave rectifier circuit constructed with ideal diodes
( the voltage across the diode, in forward conduction, equals 0 volts).
The actual diodes used in the circuit will have a forward voltage of
around 0.6 V.

Warning
:::

Before connecting the circuit to the STEMlab -3.3V and +3.3V pins double
check your circuit. The -3.3V and +3.3V voltage supply pins do not have
short circuit handling and they can be damaged in case of short circuit.

Note
:::

As we can see from the figure 6 the circuit shown on figure 4 is indeed
a full wave rectifier where diode threshold voltages are NOT causing any
affects as it is case in diode rectifiers. Also we can see that DC
offset value is not excluded from the rectifying process making this
circuit a **absolute value circuit**.The name **absolute value circuit**
comes from the fact that, as we can see from the figure 6, the output
signal (IN2) is an absolute value of the input signal (IN1).

## Questions

1.  What happens if the direction of the diodes is reversed? Repeat
    experiment with the direction of both diodes reversed.
2.  What happens if the direction of one diode is opposite of the other?
    Repeat experiment with the direction of one diode (D1) reversed.
