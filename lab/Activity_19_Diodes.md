conventional Si diode, the Schottky barrier diode, the Zener diode and
Light emitting diode (LED).

# Background

The PN junction diode is a device which is commonly used in circuit
applications such as rectification where current is allowed to flow in
only one direction. When the diode is fabricated in silicon, the forward
voltage drop is typically 0.7 V and the ${V_D}$ vs. ${I_D}$
characteristic relating diode voltage and current can be described by an
exponential relationship:

$$I_D = I_S \bigg( e^{\frac{V_Dq}{nkT}} - 1  \bigg)   \quad (1)$$

where $I_{S}$ and n are scale factors, and $kT/q$ (25.4 mV at room
temperature) is the so called thermal voltage ${V_T}$.

# Diode schematic symbols

Each type of diode has a specific schematic symbol which are variations
of the conventional diode symbol shown on the left in figure 1. A sort
of "Z" shaped cathode denotes a zener diode as in the second symbol in
figure 1. An "S" shaped cathode denotes a Schottky diode as in the next
symbol. The arrows pointing away from the diode denotes an LED as in the
symbol on the right. Arrows pointing toward the diode would represent a
photo diode light detector.

# Zener Diode Fundamentals

A Zener diode is similar in construction and operation to an ordinary
diode. Unlike a conventional diode where the intended use is to prevent
current in the reverse direction, a zener diode is mostly used in the
reverse region above the breakdown voltage. Its $I$ vs, $V$
characteristic curve is similar to ordinary diode. By adjusting the
doping of the P and N sides of the junction, it is possible to design a
Zener diode that breaks down at anywhere from a few volts to a few
hundred volts. See Figure 2. In this breakdown or zener region the diode
voltage will remain approximately constant over a wide range of
currents. The maximum reverse-bias potential that can be applied before
entering the Zener region is called the Peak Inverse Voltage (PIV) or
the Peak Reverse Voltage (PRV).

![](img/Activity_19_Fig_02.png)

Figure 2: Forward and reverse zener diode $I/V$ characteristic

At voltages above the onset of breakdown, an increase in applied voltage
will cause more current to flow in the diode, but the voltage across the
diode will stay very nearly at $V_Z$. A Zener diode operated in reverse
breakdown can provide a reference voltage for systems like voltage
regulators or voltage comparators.

# Schottky Diode Fundamentals

A Schottky barrier diode uses a rectifying metal-semiconductor junction
formed by plating, evaporating or sputtering one of a variety of metals
onto n-type or p-type semiconductor material. Generally, n-type silicon
and n-type GaAs are used in commercially available Schottky diodes. The
properties of a forward biased Schottky barrier diode are determined by
majority carrier phenomena. A conventional PN junction diode\'s
properties are determined by minority carriers. Schottky diodes are
majority carrier devices that can be switched rapidly from forward to
reverse bias without minority carrier storage effects.

The normal current vs. voltage $I/V$ curve of a Schottky barrier diode
resembles that of a PN junction diode with the following exceptions:

1.  The reverse breakdown voltage of a Schottky barrier diode is lower
    and the reverse leakage current higher than those of a PN junction
    diode made using the same resistivity semiconductor material.
2.  The forward voltage at a specific forward current is also lower for
    a Schottky barrier diode than for a PN junction diode. For example,
    at 2 mA forward bias current a low barrier silicon Schottky diode
    will have a forward voltage of \~0.3 volts while a silicon PN
    junction diode will have a voltage of \~0.7 volts. This lower
    forward voltage drop can cut the power dissipated in the diode by
    more than one half. This power savings can be very significant when
    the diodes need to carry large forward currents. The current vs.
    voltage ($I/V$) relationship for a Schottky barrier diode is given
    by the following equation known as the Richardson equation. The
    primary difference from the conventional diode equation is in $I_S$
    with the addition of the modified Richardson constant $A^*$.

$$I_D = I_S \bigg( e^{\frac{V_Dq}{nkT}} - 1  \bigg)   \quad (2)$$

$$I_S = A A^* T^2 e^{-\frac{q \Phi B}{kT}}   \quad (3)$$

Where:

-   $A$ = junction area
-   $A^*$ = modified Richardson constant (value varies by material and
    dopant) = $110 A/(Â°K^2-cm^2)$ for n-type Si
-   $T$ = absolute temperature in $K$ (Kelvins)
-   $q$ = electronic charge = $1.6E-19 \quad C$
-   $\Phi B$ = barrier height in volts k = Boltzman\'s constant = 1.37
    \* 10-23 J/K = $1.37E-23 \quad J/K$
-   $n$ = ideality factor (forward slope factor, determined by
    metal-semiconductor interface)

# LED Fundamentals

The LED is a junction diode that emits light when forward biased.
Actually all PN junction diodes emit photons when forward biased, it is
just that the photons are in the infrared band and the physical shape of
the diode does not allow the photons to escape the package. To achieve
the visible light emitting property, it is necessary to fabricate the
LED from materials with larger band-gaps other than silicon. As a
result, the forward voltage drop of the LED is greater than 0.7V;
usually on the order of 1.5 to 2 volts depending on the wavelength of
the emitted light. The LED is also built in a special transparent
package as shown in figure 3.

![](img/Activity_19_Fig_03.png)

Figure 3: Light emitting diodes

An LED is a semiconductor device that emits electromagnetic radiation at
optical and infrared frequencies. The device is a PN junction diode made
from p-type and n-type semiconductors, usually GaAs, GaP or SiC. They
emit light only when an external applied voltage is used to forward bias
the diode above a minimum threshold value. The gain in electrical
potential energy delivered by this voltage is sufficient to force
electrons to flow out of the n-type material, across the junction
barrier, and into the p-type region. This threshold voltage for the
onset of current flow across the junction and the production of light is
$V_0$. The emission of light occurs after electrons enter into the
p-region (and holes into the n-region). These electrons are a small
minority surrounded by holes (essentially the anti-particles of the
electrons) and they will quickly find a hole to recombine with.
Energetically, the electron relaxes from the excited state (conduction
band) to the ground state (valence band). The diodes are called light
emitting because the energy given up by the electron as it relaxes is
emitted as a photon. Above the threshold value, the current and light
output increases exponentially with the bias voltage across the diode.
The quanta of energy or photon has an energy E = hf. The relation
between the photon energy and the turn-on voltage $V_0$, is:

$$eV_0 = E_g = hf = \frac{hc}{\lambda} \quad (4)$$

where:

-   $E_g$ is the size of the energy gap
-   $V_0$ is the threshold voltage
-   $f$ and $\lambda$ are the frequency and wavelength of the emitted
    photons
-   $c$ is the velocity of light
-   $e$ is the electronic charge
-   $h$ is Planck\'s constant

## Experiments

# PN junction diode VI characteristic

The current vs. voltage characteristics of the PN junction diode can be
measured using the STEMlab and the following connections shown in figure
4. Set up the breadboard with the generator OUT1 channel output attached
to one end of the resistor. The other end of the resistor is connected
to one end of the diode being measured as shown in the diagram. The
inputs channels IN1 and IN2 are also connected different ends the
resistor, therefore diode current and voltage will be given as:

$$I_d = (IN_1 - IN_2) / R_1$$$$.$$$$V_d = IN_2$$

![](img/Activity_19_Fig_04.png)

Figure 4: Connection diagram for diode I vs. V curves

For measuring current vs. voltage characteristics of the PN junction
diode OUT1 generator should be configured as 1kHz triangle wave with 1 V
max and 0 V min values. For measuring $VI$ curve an \"XY\" plot is
required where x-axis will represent diode voltage $IN_2$ and y-axis a
diode current $(IN_1 - IN_2) / R_1$. For this task we will use Jupyter
Notebook Web application.

The [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/index.html)
[Notebook](http://jupyter.org/index.html) is a web application that
allows you to create and share documents that contain live code,
equations, visualizations and explanatory text. They have also ensured
support for the Jupyter application with Red Pitaya libraries enabling
control of all features of the STEMlab boards such as: signal
acquisition, signal generation, digital signal control, communication
etc. The Jupyter Notebook is started on the same way as any other
applications. After starting Jupyter application a web based notebook is
opened. This combination of the notebook, STEMlab and Python features
makes the STEMlab an excellent tool for prototyping and quick
programing. Since Jupyter Notebook enables text, equation and picture
editing this is a perfect tool for tutorials, examples etc.

But before measuring $VI$ curve you should check voltages signals using
Oscilloscope & Signal generator application.

# Materials

-   Solder-less Breadboard
-   Resistor 10 Î©
-   Conventional diode (1N4001 or similar)

# Procedure - time domain measurements

1.  Build the circuit from figure 4 on the breadboard

![](img/Activity_19_Fig_05.png)

Figure 5: Connections on the breadboard

2.  Start the Oscilloscope & Signal generator application
3.  In the OUT1 settings menu set Amplitude value to 0.5V, DC offset to
    0.5V to apply a triangle wave as the input voltage. From the
    waveform menu select TRIANGLE, deselect SHOW button and select
    enable.
4.  On the left bottom of the screen be sure that IN1 V/div is set to
    200mV/div (You can set V/div by selecting the desired channel and
    using vertical +/- controls)
5.  On the left bottom of the screen be sure that IN2 V/div is set to
    200mV/div (You can set V/div by selecting the desired channel and
    using vertical +/- controls)
6.  Set t/div value to 200us/div (You can set t/div using horizontal +/-
    controls)
7.  In the MATH settings menu set IN1-IN2 and select enable. **Math
    trace scaled by factor R1 represent diode current**

![](img/Activity_19_Fig_06.png)

Figure 6: Voltages and current on the diode (Time dependent)

From figure 6 we can see that diode start conducting when the voltage on
it exceed diode threshold voltage which is around 0.6V.

Also, diode current represented with MATH trace is observable. We can
clearly see that when the diode voltage is below 0.6 the diode current
is 0A. At point when the diode voltage exceed 0.6V diode starts
conducting and the path current is only limited by resistor R1.

# Procedure - VI characteristics measurements

For this task we will use Jupyter Notebook Web application. How to start
Jupyter Notebook and create new project is shown on figure 7 flow chart.

![](img/Activity_19_Fig_07.png)

Figure 7: Creating new Jupyter notebook

If you have successfully created new Jupyter notebook then copy-paste
code bellow and run it. Code bellow will generate same signal as from
figure 6 but it will plot them in XY graph. For measuring $VI$ curve an
\"XY\" plot is required where x-axis will represent diode voltage $IN_2$
and y-axis a diode current $(IN_1 - IN_2) / R_1$.

starting measurements again.

After running the code above you should get diode VI characteristic as
is shown on figure 8.

![](img/Activity_19_Fig_08.png)

Figure 8: Didoes VI characteristic measured using Jupyter Notebook

From the figure 8 the typical diode VI characteristic is shown. From the
figure 8 we can see that, as the voltage on the diode is increasing
(from 0-0.5V) the diode current stays near zero until voltage reaches
values near threshold voltage (\~0.6V). At this point diode is \"turned
on\" and the path current (diode current) is only limited by resistor
R1. In case when the diode voltage is decreasing the VI curve is not the
same, resulting in the diode hysteresis. Upper curve from figure 8 shows
that once the diode was \"turned on\" the lower diode voltage will cause
higher current than in the case when the diode was previously \"turned
off\". An ideal diode would not have hysteresis i.e the diode current
would be independent of previous diode states but only on the diode
voltage.
