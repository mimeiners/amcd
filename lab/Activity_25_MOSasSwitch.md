title: MOSFET transistor as a switch
---

# Objective

A MOS FET (NMOS) device can be used in many circuit configurations such
as an amplifier, oscillator, filter, rectifier or just used as an on-off
switch. If the FET is biased into the saturation region, it will operate
as an amplifier or other linear circuit, if biased alternately in the
linear (triode) region and cut-off region, then it is being used as a
switch, allowing current to flow or not to flow in other parts of the
circuit. This lab activity describes the NMOS device when operated as a
switch.

# Notes

referring to the connections to the Red Pitaya STEMlab board

Red Pitaya STEMlab outputs can generate voltage signals with maximal
output range of +/- 1V (2Vpp). For this experiment the higher signal
amplitudes are required in order \"turn on\" NMOS transistor ($V_{TH}$
voltage). Because of that we will use an
[OP484](http://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/OP184_284_484.pdf)
in the
[inverting](http://red-pitaya-active-learning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Activity13_BasicOPAmpConfigurations.html#inverting-amplifier)
opamp configuration to enable OUT1/OUT2 signal amplification achieving
voltage swing between +4.7V to -3.2V. An OP484 will be supplied from
STEMlab +5V and -3.3V voltage rails. Gain of the inverting amplifier
will be set to \~5, where $R_i  = 2.2k \Omega$ and $R_f  = 10k \Omega$.
Try to answer why we have used an OP484 instead for example OP27 or
OP97. (hint \"rail-to-rail\").

# Background

Switching circuits are significantly different than linear circuits.
They are also easier to understand. Before investigating more complex
circuits, we will begin by introducing discrete solid-state switching
circuits: those built around NMOS devices.

A switch consists of a NMOS transistor that is alternately driven
between the triode and cutoff regions. A simple version of the switch is
shown in figure 1. When the input equals $-V_{in}$, the gate-source
voltage is less than the threshold voltage ($-V_{TH}$) or off so no
current flows in the drain. This is illustrated by the red load line
shown in the figure. When the NMOS is in cutoff, the circuit (ideally)
has the following values:

$$V_{DS} = V_{DD} \quad \text{and} \quad I_D = 0  A \quad (1)$$

This state is similar to an open switch. When the input equals $V_{TH}$,
the transistor is driven into the triode region and the following
conditions occur:

$$V_{DS} \approx 0 \quad \text{and} \quad I_D = \frac{V_{DD}}{R_D} A \quad (2)$$

This state is similar to a closed switch connecting the bottom of $R_D$
to ground.

Figure 1: NMOS FET switch and its load line

The characteristics for an enhancement mode NMOS switch assume that:

1.  $-V_{in}$ is low enough to drive the transistor into cutoff.
2.  $+V_{in}$ must be greater than $V_{TH}$ to drive the transistor into
    triode
3.  The transistor is an ideal component.

These conditions can be assured by designing the circuit so that:

1.  $-V_{in} = V_{TH}$
2.  $+V_{in} = V_{TH}$ ($V_{DD}$ is a good maximum)

Condition 1 guarantees that the circuit is driven into the cutoff region
by the input. Conditions 2 assure that the transistor will be driven
into the triode region.

An actual NMOS switch differs from the ideal switch in several aspects.
In practice, even in cutoff there is some small leakage current through
the transistor. Also, in triode, there is always some voltage dropped
across the transistor\'s internal resistance, $R_{ON}$. Typically, this
will be between 0.1 and 0.2 V in triode depending on the drain current
and size of the device. These variations from the ideal are generally
minor with a properly sized device, so we can assume near ideal
conditions when analyzing or designing a NMOS switch circuit.

# Procedure

The common application for a NMOS (or any other) switch is to drive an
LED. An LED driver is shown in figure 2. The driver shown in this figure
is used to couple a low current part of the circuit to a relatively high
current device (the LED). When the output from the low current circuit
is low (0 V), the transistor is in cutoff and the LED is off. When the
output from the low current circuit goes high (above $V_{TH}$), the
transistor is driven into triode and the LED lights. The driver is used
because the low-current part of the circuit may not have the current
capability to supply the 20 mA (typical) required to light the LED to
full brightness.

1.  Build the LED switch circuit shown in figure 2 on your solder-less
    breadboard. $R_D$ serves to limit the current that flows in the LED
    from the +5 V power supply. The switch is controlled by the OUT1
    voltage output amplified by OP484 inverting amplifier. Scope channel
    IN will display the voltage across the the LED as indicated on
    figure 2.
2.  For $R_D$ take 100 $\Omega$ resistor. For $R_G$ take 10 $k \Omega$.
    Gate resistor connected to the GND is a good practice in order to
    prevent undesired transistor switching caused by static electricity.

3.  Start the Oscilloscope & Signal generator application
4.  In the OUT1 settings menu set Amplitude value to 0.5V, DC offset to
    -0.5 V, Frequency to 10Hz to apply the input voltage. From the
    waveform menu select SQUARE, deselect SHOW and select enable.
5.  On the left bottom of the screen be sure that IN1 V/div is set to
    2V/div and IN2 is set to 1V/div (You can set V/div by selecting the
    desired channel and using vertical +/- controls)
6.  Set t/div value to 20ms/div (You can set t/div using horizontal +/-
    controls)
7.  Under IN2 and IN1 menu settings set probe to x10 and vertical offset
    to 0.

Figure 4: NMOS as a switch measurements

From figure 4 we can observe NMOS transistor behavior when it is
operating as a switch. When the base voltage is \"high\" the transistor
is \"turned on\" enabling current flow from +5V voltage rail trough
diode to the GND. When current starts flowing the LED will blink. In
this \"turned on\" state we can see that IN2 (LED voltage do not goes to
0 V). This is is the affect of the forward drop down voltages of the LED
diode and M1 transistor. From figure 4 we can measure this drop down
voltage do be \~1.9V. Try to measure what amount of drop down voltage is
caused by M1 and what amount by LED. When base voltage is \"low\"
transistor is \"turned off\" disabling current flow therefore the LED
voltage will be same as R1 i.e 5V.

We can observe \"turn on event\" of M1 by selecting TRIANGLE waveform of
OUT1. From figure 5 we can see when Gate signal goes above $V_{TH}$ the
transistor is turned on.

Transistor $R_{ON}$ parameter is crucial in high current application
since power dissipation will be dependent on current flowing trough
transistor and $R_{ON}$ value.
