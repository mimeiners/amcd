title: BJT transistor as a switch
---

# Objective

A bipolar junction transistor (BJT) can be used in many circuit
configurations such as an amplifier, oscillator, filter, rectifier or
just used as an on-off switch. If the transistor is biased into the
linear region, it will operate as an amplifier or other linear circuit,
if biased alternately in the saturation and cut-off regions, then it is
being used as a switch, allowing current to flow or not to flow in other
parts of the circuit. This experiment describes the BJT when operated as
a switch.

# Notes

In this tutorials we use the terminology taken from the user manual when
referring to the connections to the Red Pitaya STEMlab board
[hardware](http://redpitaya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/developerGuide/125-10/top.html).

# Background

Switching circuits are significantly different than linear circuits.
They are also easier to understand. Before investigating more complex
circuits, we will begin by introducing discrete solid-state switching
circuits: those built around BJTs.

A switch consists of a BJT transistor that is alternately driven between
the saturation and cutoff regions. A simple version of the switch is
shown in figure 1. When the input equals $-V_{in}$ , the base-emitter
junction is reverse biased or off so no current flows in the collector.
This is illustrated by the red load line shown in the figure. When the
BJT is in cutoff, the circuit (ideally) has the following values:

$$V_{CE} = V_{CC} \quad \text{and} \quad I_C = 0  A \quad (1)$$

This state is similar to an open switch. When the input equals
$+V_{in}$, the transistor is driven into saturation and the following
conditions occur:

$$V_{CE} \approx 0 \quad \text{and} \quad I_{C_{sat}} = \frac{V_{CC}}{R_C} A \quad (2)$$

This state is similar to a closed switch connecting the bottom of $R_C$
to ground.

The characteristics for a BJT switch assume that:

1.  $-V_{in}$ is low enough to drive the transistor into cutoff.
2.  $+V_{in}$ must produce enough base current through RB to drive the
    transistor into saturation.
3.  The transistor is an ideal component.

These conditions can be assured by designing the circuit so that:

1.  $-V_{in}=V_{BE}$
2.  $+V_{in} = V_{BE} + I_B R_B$ ($V_{CC}$ is a good maximum)
3.  $I_B > I_{C_{sat}} / \beta$

Condition 1 guarantees that the circuit is driven into the cutoff region
by the input. Conditions 2 and 3 assure that the transistor will be
driven into the saturation region. An actual BJT switch differs from the
ideal switch in several aspects. In practice, even in cutoff there is
some small leakage current through the transistor. Also, in saturation,
there is always some voltage dropped across the transistor\'s internal
resistance. Typically, this will be between 0.2 and 0.4 V in saturation
depending on the collector current and size of the device. These
variations from the ideal are generally minor with a properly sized
device, so we can assume near ideal conditions when analyzing or
designing a BJT switch circuit.

2.  Start the Oscilloscope & Signal generator application
3.  In the OUT1 settings menu set Amplitude value to 0.5V, DC offset to
    0.5 V, Frequency to 10Hz to apply the input voltage. From the
    waveform menu select SQUARE, deselect SHOW and select enable.
4.  On the left bottom of the screen be sure that IN1 V/div is set to
    200mV/div and IN2 is set to 1V/div (You can set V/div by selecting
    the desired channel and using vertical +/- controls)
5.  Set t/div value to 20ms/div (You can set t/div using horizontal +/-
    controls)
6.  Under IN2 menu settings set probe to x10 and vertical offset to 0.
7.  Under IN1 set vertical offset to 0.

Figure 4: NPN as a switch measurements

From figure 4 we can observe NPN transistor behavior when it is
operating as a switch. When the base voltage is \"high\" the transistor
is \"turned on\" enabling current flow from +5V voltage rail trough
diode to the GND. When current starts flowing the LED will blink. In
this \"turned on\" state we can see that IN2 (LED voltage do not goes to
0 V). This is is the affect of the forward drop down voltages of the LED
diode and Q1 transistor. From figure 4 we can measure this drop down
voltage do be \~2.2V. Try to measure what amount of drop down voltage is
caused by Q1 and what amount by LED. When base voltage is \"low\"
transistor is \"turned off\" disabling current flow therefore the LED
voltage will be same as R1 i.e 5V.

# Questions

1.  How much current is flowing in resistors $R_C$ and $R_B$ when the
    LED is on and when the LED is off?
2.  Calculate the $\beta$ when Q1 is saturated. How does this value
    compare to the spec listed in the
    [datasheet](https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/2N3904.pdf)?
