title: Resonance in RLC Circuits
---

# Objective

The objective of this Lab activity is to study the phenomenon of
resonance in RLC circuits. Determine the resonant frequency and
bandwidth of the given network using the amplitude response to a
sinusoidal source.

# Notes

In this tutorials we use the terminology taken from the user manual when
referring to the connections to the Red Pitaya STEMlab board
[hardware](http://redpitaya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/developerGuide/125-10/top.html).

Oscilloscope & Signal generator application is used for generating and
observing signals on the circuit.
[Bode](http://redpitaya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/appsFeatures/apps-featured/bode/bode.html)
analyzer application is used to measure frequency response of RLC
circuit.

# Background

A resonant circuit, also called a tuned circuit consists of an inductor
and a capacitor together with a voltage or current source. It is one of
the most important circuits used in electronics. For example, a resonant
circuit, in one of many forms, allows us to tune into a desired radio or
television station from the vast number of signals that are around us at
any time.

A network is in resonance when the voltage and current at the network
input terminals are in phase and the input impedance of the network is
purely resistive.

![Figure 1: Parallel Resonance Circuit](img/Activity_08_Fig_01.png)

Consider the parallel RLC circuit of Fig. 1. The steady-state admittance
offered by the circuit is:

$$Y = \frac{1}{R} + j \left( \omega C - \frac{1}{\omega L} \right)$$

Resonance occurs when the voltage and current at the input terminals are
in phase. This corresponds to a purely real admittance, so that the
necessary condition is given by:

$$\omega C - \frac{1}{\omega L} = 0$$

The resonant condition may be achieved by adjusting L, C, or $\omega$.
Keeping L and C constant, the resonant frequency $\omega_0$ is given by:

$$\omega_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}} \, rad/s (1)$$

or

$$f_0 = \frac {1}{2 \pi \sqrt{LC}} \, Hz  (2)$$

Frequency Response: It is a plot of the magnitude of the output Voltage
of a resonance circuit as function of frequency. The response of course
starts at zero, reaches a maximum value in the vicinity of the natural
resonant frequency, and then drops again to zero as ω becomes infinite.
The frequency response is shown in figure 2.

![Figure 2: Frequency Response of Parallel Resonant
Circuit](img/Activity_08_Fig_02.png)

The two additional frequencies ω :sub: [1]{.title-ref} and ω ~2~ are
also indicated which are called half-power frequencies. These
frequencies locate those points on the curve at which the voltage
response is $1/sqrt(2)$ or 0.707 times the maximum value. They are used
to measure the band-width of the response curve. This is called the
half-power bandwidth of the resonant circuit and is defined as:

$$\beta = \omega_2 - \omega_1  (3)$$

# Procedure

Additional Calculation: Using one of the sw tools such is Matlab or
Python we can calculate the impedance of the parallel RLC circuit from
Figure 1.

The admittance(Y) of the parallel circuit is given in equation 1 above
where impedance Z is given as Z = 1 / Y.

In this calculation we take into account series resistance of the
inductor. This resistance will affect the phase response of the RLC
circuit at lower frequencies. Equation above are used for ideal
components without parasitic elements. In practice (measurements) we
only have real elements and we need to take into account that inductor
is not a pure inductance but also has an effective series resistance
$R_{esr}$, hence

$$Y_{L} = \frac{1}{(R_{esr} + j 2 \pi f L)}.$$

The resonance frequency is defined as the frequency at which the
[impedance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_impedance) of the
circuit is at a minimum. Equivalently, it can be defined as the
frequency at which the impedance is purely real (that is, purely
resistive). This occurs because the impedances of the inductor and
capacitor at resonance are equal but of opposite sign and cancel out.
Circuits where L and C are in parallel rather than series actually have
a maximum impedance rather than a minimum impedance. For this reason
they are often described as
[antiresonators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiresonance), it is
still usual, however, to name the frequency at which this occurs as the
resonance frequency.

Matlab code for calculation of $Z$ is given below.

``` matlab
close all
clear all
clc
Rs = 100;
R1 = 1E3;
L1 = 4.7E-3;
C1 = 0.1E-6;
Resr = 6.5;       % inductor series resistance in Ohms
Vin = 1;
f = 100:100:1E6;  % frequency range for calculation

%% calculation of Z
Y1 = 1/R1;
Y2 = i*2*pi.*f*C1;
Y3 = 1./(Rind+i*2*pi.*f*L1);
Y = Y1 + Y2 + Y3;
Z = 1./Y;

%% Plotting
ax = plotyy(f,real(Z),f,imag(Z),'semilogx','semilogx');
ylabel(ax(1), 'Real part of  Z / Ohms');
ylabel(ax(2), 'Real part of  Z / Ohms');
xlabel('Frequency / Hz');

```

By running code above we get following results shown on picture bellow.

![Figure 4: Calculation of the Impedance Z of parallel RLC circuit. Blue
trace real/resistive part of Z, green trace imaginary/reactive part of
Z.](img/Activity_08_Fig_04.png)

We can also calculate absolute value of Z which is the combined
impedance of RLC circuit from Figure 1. Absolute value of Impedance Z is
the parameter form which we can predict what the measurements should
look like.

We can model the circuit from Figure 8 as is shown on figure below where
Z = 1/Y and Y is given in equation 1.

![Figure 5: Representing parallel RLC circuit as a complex impedance
Z](img/Activity_08_Fig_05.png)

From figure 5 above we can clearly see that our circuit is simple
voltage divider where Vout=Vin\*Z/(Rs+Z). But since the Z is frequency
dependent the ratio between Z and Rs will be frequency dependent and
with that the Vin/Vout ratio.

At some frequency f: where the value of Z is much smaller than value of
Rs the output voltage amplitude will be much smaller than input voltage
amplitude.

At some frequency f: where value of Z is much higher than value of Rs
the output voltage amplitude will be close to the input voltage
amplitude

At some frequency f: where Z=Rs the Vout will be ½ Vin.

At some frequency f: where Z is maximal the Vout will be also maximal.
This is the resonant frequency.

![Figure 6: Calculation of absolute value of impedance Z for the circuit
shown on figure 3.](img/Activity_08_Fig_06.png)

Using

$$V_{out} = V_{in} \frac{Z}{R_s + Z}$$

we can calculate the frequency response of our RLC circuit shown in
Figs. 5 and 8.

figure 5.](img/Activity_08_Fig_07.png)

Procedure:

1.  Set up the RLC circuit as shown in figure 8 on your solderless
    breadboard, with the component values RS = 100 Ω, R1 = 1 KΩ, C1 =
    0.1 µF and L1= 4.7 mH.

![Figure 8: Parallel RLC circuit for the
measurements.](img/Activity_08_Fig_08.png)

2.  Open the Bode analyzer application. In "Settings" menu set start
    frequency to 100Hz, end frequency to 1MHz and number of steps to 50.
    And Click "RUN" button.

![Figure 9: Bode analyzer application](img/Activity_08_Fig_09.png)

After the measurements are done you should get the frequency response of
your circuit as is shown on Figure 10q.

![Figure 10: Frequency response of circuit from Figure 8 take by Bode
analyzer application.](img/Activity_08_Fig_10.png)

-   Compare measurements and calculation. If there is any difference try
    to explain why.

The Bode analyzer application will make a frequency sweep in such way it
will generate sine signal on OUT1 within frequency range selected by
us(in settings menu).

IN1 input signal is directly connected to OUT1 following that IN1=Vin.
IN2 is connected on the other side of the RLC circuit and from that
IN2=Vout. Bode analyzer application will then for each frequency step
take the ratio of IN1/IN2 and calculate frequency response.

2.  On order to see how Vout/IN2 signal amplitude is changing in respect
    to OUT1 start the Oscilloscope application, in OUT1 settings enable
    OUT1, deselect SHOW button and look at the signal amplitudes of IN1
    and IN2.

    Change the OUT1 frequency, adjust t/div value so you have 2 cycles
    of the IN1 and observe the amplitudes of IN1 and IN2.

    Repeat this step for OUT1 frequency from 100Hz to 1MHz and you
    should observe same amplitude response as it is measured by Bode
    analyzer application.

    Bode analyzer is also measuring phase between IN1 and IN2. Phase is
    also frequency dependent. You can see that easily wit the
    Oscilloscope application.

3.  Repeat the experiment using for the series resonant circuit in
    figure 3, and use L1 = 20 mH and C1 = 0.01 uF and R1 = 1 KΩ. The Vo
    voltage on the resistor is proportional to the series RLC circuit
    current.
