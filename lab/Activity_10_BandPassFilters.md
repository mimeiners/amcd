title: Band Pass Filters
---

# Objective

The objective of this Lab activity is to:

1.  Construct a Band Pass Filter by cascading a low pass filter and a
    high pass filter.
2.  Obtain the frequency response of the filter using
    [Bode](http://redpitaya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/appsFeatures/apps-featured/bode/bode.html)
    analyzer application.

# Notes

In this tutorials we use the terminology taken from the user manual when
referring to the connections to the Red Pitaya STEMlab board
[hardware](http://redpitaya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

[Bode](http://redpitaya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/appsFeatures/apps-featured/bode/bode.html)
analyzer application is used to measure frequency response of Low Pass
and High Pass Filters.

The Bode analyzer is an ideal application for measuring frequency
responses of the passive/active filters, complex impedances and any
other electronic circuit. The Gain/Phase frequency response can be used
to characterize any device under test completely, you can perform linear
and logarithmic sweeps. Gain and Phase can be measured from 1Hz to
60MHz. The basic user interface enables quick interaction and parameter
settings. The Bode analyzer can be used for the measurement of Stability
of control circuits such as the DC/DC converters in power supplies,
Influence of termination on amplifiers or filters, Ultrasonic and piezo
electric systems and similar.

# Background

A Band Pass Filter allows a specific range of frequencies to pass, while
blocking or attenuating lower and higher frequencies. It passes
frequencies between the two cut-off frequencies while attenuating
frequencies outside the cut-off frequencies. One typical application of
a band pass filter is in Audio Signal Processing, where a specific range
of frequencies of sound are desired while attenuating the rest. Another
application is in the selection of a specific signal from a range of
signals in communication systems. A band pass filter may be constructed
by cascading a High Pass RL filter with a roll-off frequency $f_L$ and a
Low Pass RC filter with a roll-off frequency $f_H$, such that:

$$f_L < f_H$$

The Lower cut-off frequency is given as:

$$f_L = \frac{R}{2 \pi L} \quad (1)$$

The higher cut-off frequency is given as:

$$f_H = \frac{1}{2 \pi RC} \quad (2)$$

The **Band Width** of frequencies passed is given by:

$$BW = f_L < f_{BW} < f_H \quad (3)$$

All signal frequencies $f$ below $f_L$ and above $f_H$ are attenuated
and the frequencies between are passed by the filter.

# Frequency Response

To show how a circuit responds to a range of frequencies a plot of the
magnitude ( amplitude ) of the output voltage of the filter as a
function of the frequency can be drawn. It is generally used to
characterize the range of frequencies in which the filter is designed to
operate within. Figure 2 shows a typical frequency response of a Band
Pass filter.

# Materials:

-   Red Pitaya STEMlab 125-14 or STEMlab 125-10
-   Resistor: 1 KΩ
-   Capacitor: 0.047 µF
-   Inductor: 22 mH

# Procedure

1.  Set up the filter circuit as shown in figure 1 and figure 3 on your
    solderless breadboard, with the component values R1 = 1 KΩ, C1 =
    0.047 µF, L1 =22 mH.

2.  Start the Bode analyzer application. The Bode analyzer application
    will make a frequency sweep in such way it will generate sine signal
    on $OUT1$ within frequency range selected by us(in settings menu).
    $IN1$ input signal is directly connected to $OUT_1$ following that
    $IN1=V_{in}$. $IN2$ is connected on the other side of the filter and
    from that $IN2=V_{out}$. Bode analyzer application will then for
    each frequency step take the ratio of $IN1/IN2$ ($V_{in}/V_{out}$)
    and calculate frequency response.

3.  In the Bode analyzer settings menu set for:

    -   start frequency: 500 Hz
    -   end frequency: 30 kHz
    -   number of steps: 50
    -   scale: Log
    -   select RUN button

# Questions:

1.  Compute the cut-off frequencies for each Band Pass filter
    constructed using the formula in equations (1) and (2). Compare
    these theoretical values to the ones obtained from the experiment
    and provide suitable explanation for any differences.
