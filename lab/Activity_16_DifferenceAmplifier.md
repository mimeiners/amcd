# Objective

Adding and/or subtracting analog signals is potentially the most common
function performed by an op-amp. This activity will investigate single
op-amp circuits for subtracting two analog signals. We have already
discussed
[Summing](http://red-pitaya-active-learning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Activity13_BasicOPAmpConfigurations.html#summing-amplifier-circuit)
[Amplifier](http://red-pitaya-active-learning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Activity13_BasicOPAmpConfigurations.html#summing-amplifier-circuit)
circuit; a single op-amp circuits for adding two (or more) analog
signals. Same behaviour we also expect here while signals in the opamp
inputs should be subtracted and not summed together.

# Notes

In this tutorials we use the terminology taken from the user manual when
referring to the connections to the Red Pitaya STEMlab board
[hardware](http://redpitaya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/developerGuide/125-10/top.html).
Extension connector pins used for **-3.3V** and **+3.3V** voltage supply
are show in the documentation
[here](http://redpitaya.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc/developerGuide/125-14/extent.html#extension-connector-e2).

# Short Background

The basic difference opamp circuit is shown in figure 1. To solve for
the transfer function $V_{out} = f(V_1,V_2)$ of the difference amplifier
we can use a superposition principle.

Figure 1: Basic Difference Amplifier

In the first step consider circuit from figure 1 where noninverting
input (pin 3) is set to the GND. We get familiar inverting amplifier
circuit which transfer function is given as

$$V_{out} = - V_1 \bigg( \frac{R_f}{R_i} \bigg)   \quad (1)$$

In second step consider the circuit from figure 1 where $V_1$ input is
set to the GND. We get familiar non-inverting amplifier circuit which
transfer function is given as

$$V_{out} = V_2 \bigg( 1 + \frac{R_f}{R_i} \bigg) \quad (2)$$

Following superposition principle we get

$$V_{out} = V_{out_{step_1}}+V_{out_{step_2}}=V_2 \bigg( 1+ \frac{R_f}{R_i} \bigg) - V_1 \bigg(\frac{R_f}{R_i} \bigg) \quad (3)$$

From the equation above we can clearly see that circuit from figure 1 is
indeed a difference amplifier where output signal $V_{out}$ is the
difference of the input signals $V_2-V_1$ amplified by factor
$\frac{R_f}{R_1}$.

For $R_f = R_i$ we get:

$$V_{out} = 2V_2 -V_1 \quad (4)$$

# Materials

-   Red Pitaya STEMlab
-   OPAMP: 1x OP484
-   Resistor: 4x 10 $k \Omega$

# Procedure

Build the difference amplifier shown in figure 2. R3 and R4 are added as
a voltage divider in order to attenuate $V_2^*$ input signal by half.
With voltage divider (R3, R4) added, for circuit shown on figure 2 and
from equation (4) we get

$$V_{out} = 2V_2 - V_1 = \frac{1}{2} 2 V_2^* - V_1 = V_2^* - V_1 = OUT_2 - OUT_1  \quad (5)$$

Warning
:::

Before connecting the circuit to the STEMlab -3.3V and +3.3V pins double
check your circuit. The -3.3V and +3.3V voltage supply pins do not have
short circuit handling and they can be damaged in case of short circuit.

Figure 3: Difference Amplifier on the breadboard

1.  Start the Oscilloscope & Signal Generator application.
2.  In the IN1 settings menu deselect SHOW button.
3.  In the OUT1 settings menu set Amplitude value to 0.2V to apply a
    0.4Vp-p sine wave centered on 0V as the input voltage $V_1$. From
    the waveform menu select SINE and select enable.
4.  In the OUT2 settings menu set Amplitude value to 0.6V to apply a
    1.2Vp-p sine wave centered on 0V as the input voltage $V_2^*$. From
    the waveform menu select SINE and select enable.
5.  For the stable acquisition set the trigger source to IN2
6.  On the left bottom of the screen be sure that IN2 V/div is set to
    200mV/div (You can set V/div by selecting the desired channel and
    using vertical +/- controls)
7.  On the left bottom of the screen be sure that OUT1 V/div and OUT2
    V/div are both set to 200mV/div (You can set V/div by selecting the
    desired channel and using vertical +/- controls)
8.  In the measurement menu select "MAX" , select IN2 and press DONE

Figure 4: Difference Amplifier measurements

Note
:::

As we can see from the measurements shown on the figure 4 our circuit
behaves as a voltage difference amplifier since IN2 amplitude is equal
to the difference between OUT2 and OUT1 amplitudes as it is predicted by
equation (5).
:::

Since both input signals are sinusoidal the only artefact of the
difference amplifier circuit on the output signal is the difference in
amplitude. But what happens when we have different waveforms of OUT1 and
OUT2.

1.  In the OUT2 settings menu select SQUARE waveform and observe results

Figure 5: Difference Amplifier measurements - Different waveforms of
OUT1 and OUT2

From figure 5 we can observe a difference amplifier output signal (IN2)
which has a strange waveform shape given as IN2(waveform)=OUT2(SQUARE) -
OUT1(SINE). This observation is absolutely confirming that circuit shown
on figure 2 is a difference amplifier.
